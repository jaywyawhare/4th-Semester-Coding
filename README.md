# 4th Semester Coding

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of code and projects from my 4th semester coursework. During this semester, I focused on subjects such as Web Technology, Operating System, and DBMS. Here, you will find a wide range of assignments, lab work, and classwork questions, organized by topic and lab.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

1. <b> DBMS Lab </b>: This directory contains SQL scripts, log files, and relevant files for the Database Management System (DBMS) lab. It includes exercises, queries, and practical work that cover various aspects of database design, manipulation, and querying. The log files provide a record of the database transactions and activities.
1. <b> OS Lab </b>: In the OS Lab directory, you will find exercises, shell programs, scheduling algorithms, and Linux commands related to the Operating System course. These programs explore concepts like process management, file systems, memory management, and more. The directory is further organized by different lab sessions and their respective exercises.
1. <b> Web Technology </b>: The Web Technology directory contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java files from the web technology classes. Here, you will discover files that cover topics such as web design, client-side scripting, interactivity, styling, and Java-based web applications. The files are organized by date or topic, reflecting the progress of the course.
1. <b> Web Technology Lab </b> : Within this directory, you can explore the lab exercises and projects specific to the Web Technology lab. It includes practical assignments and hands-on projects that allow for the application and implementation of web development concepts. The files are organized based on the lab sessions or specific exercises.

## Purpose and Usage

This repository is intended to showcase my progress and proficiency in coding during the 4th semester of my studies. It demonstrates my understanding and practical application of various programming concepts and technologies. By organizing the coursework by subject and lab, it provides a convenient way to navigate and explore specific topics of interest.

Feel free to browse through the directories to find code snippets, complete projects, and relevant documentation related to web technology, operating systems, and database management systems. The repository can serve as a valuable resource for students, programmers, or anyone interested in learning about these subjects or exploring coding examples.

Please note that the code and files in this repository were created during my 4th semester, and they represent my skills and knowledge at that time. While I strive to maintain the integrity of the code, improvements and updates may have been made since then.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you spot any issues, errors, or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions will help enhance the quality and accuracy of the code and make it a more valuable resource for others.

Happy exploring and coding!
